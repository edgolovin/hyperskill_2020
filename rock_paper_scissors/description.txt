At last stage a player can input any sequence of choices for gaming, for example:
['rock', 'fire', 'scissors', 'snake', 'human', 'tree', 'wolf', 'sponge', 'paper', 'air', 'water','dragon', 'devil', 'lightning', 'gun']

the user should provide a list of options separated by comma

Objectives
Your program should:

Output a line Enter your name: . Note that the user should enter his/her name on the same line (not the one following the output!)
Read input specifying the user's name and output a new line Hello, <name>
Read a file named rating.txt and check if there's a record for the user with the same name; if yes, use the score specified in the rating.txt for this user as a starting point for calculating the score in the current game. If no, start counting user's score from 0.
Read input specifying the list of options that will be used for playing the game (options are separated by comma). If the input is an empty line, play with default options. 
Output a line Okay, let's start
Play the game by the rules defined on the previous stages:
Read user's input
If the input is !exit, output Bye! and stop the game
If the input is the name of the option, then:
Pick a random option
Output a line with the result of the game in the following format (<option> is the name of the option chosen by the program):
Lose -> Sorry, but computer chose <option>
Draw -> There is a draw (<option>)
Win -> Well done. Computer chose <option> and failed
For each draw, add 50 point to the score. For each user's win, add 100 to his/her score. In case the user loses, don't change the score. 
If the input corresponds to anything else, output Invalid input
Play the game again (with the same options that were defined before the start of the game)
